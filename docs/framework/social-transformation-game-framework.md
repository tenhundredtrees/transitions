## 📊 Dynamic Feasibility Scoring System

### Base Feasibility Formula
```
Feasibility Score = (S × Ws + E × We + T × Wt) / (Ws + We + Wt)

Where:
- S = Social feasibility (0-10)
- E = Economic feasibility (0-10)
- T = Technical feasibility (0-10)
- W = Weights (context-dependent)
```

### Dynamic Adjustments

#### Trust Multiplier
```
If community trust > 5: Multiply score by 1.2
If community trust < 3: Multiply score by 0.8
```

#### Success Demonstration Effect
```
For each successful implementation nearby:
- Add 0.5 to social feasibility
- Add 0.3 to economic feasibility
```

#### Resource Availability Modifier
```
If external resources available: +1 to all scores
If only local resources: -0.5 to technical score
```

#### Political Support Factor
```
Active support: +2 to all scores
Neutral: No change
Opposition: -3 to all scores
```

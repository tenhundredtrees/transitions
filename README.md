# Transitions: Algorithms for Social Change 🌾

> *Transforming districts into self-governing ecosystems through AI-enhanced collaboration*

## What is Transitions?

**Transitions** is a practical framework that helps districts become self-governing by connecting existing entities—farms, businesses, schools, newspapers—so they can play multiple roles and create economic value chains. We use AI to coordinate this collaboration 24/7 while preserving human decision-making.

### The Big Idea: Role Adjacency

Every entity expands beyond its primary role:
- **🥛 Dairy** → Manure → Fertilizer → Farming
- **📰 Newspaper** → Youth volunteers → Skills training
- **🏫 School** → Community center → Local governance
- **🌍 Diaspora** → Funding → Technology transfer

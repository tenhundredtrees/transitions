# Village Resilience and Sustainability Scoring Framework (0-100 Scale)

## Overview: Comprehensive Village Assessment Matrix

This framework provides a standardized method to evaluate and score villages on a 0-100 scale across nine critical dimensions of sustainability and resilience. Higher scores indicate greater self-reliance, environmental sustainability, and community resilience.

| 2. Water Resource Management | 15 | Critical resource, affects all other activities |
| 3. Energy Independence | 12 | Essential for modern village economy |
| 4. Livestock and Nutrition | 10 | Protein security and economic diversification |
| 5. Vocational Self-Reliance | 10 | Local problem-solving capacity |
| 6. Economic Resilience & Trade | 10 | External connectivity and financial stability |
| 7. Technology Integration | 8 | Competitive advantage and efficiency |
| 8. Environmental Health | 8 | Long-term sustainability foundation |
| 9. Social Cohesion & Culture | 7 | Community strength and identity |
| 10. Governance & Planning | 5 | Decision-making and coordination capacity |
